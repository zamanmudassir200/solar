Thought for 6 secondsI'll create a complete authentication system with login and signup pages that integrate with your API endpoints and include email verification using Nodemailer.

```typescriptreact project="auth-system"
...
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

For the Nodemailer integration to work properly, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=300S
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=faaizfah2004@gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_FROM=faaizfah2004@gmail.com
```

## How It Works

1. **Authentication Flow**:

1. Users can sign up with their email and password
2. After signup, a verification email is sent using Nodemailer
3. Users must verify their email by clicking the link in the email
4. After verification, users can log in with their credentials



2. **API Integration**:

1. The app integrates with your local API endpoints:

1. `/v1/register` for user registration
2. `/v1/login` for user authentication
3. Additional endpoints for email verification and password reset






3. **Email Verification**:

1. Nodemailer is used to send verification emails
2. The email contains a link with a token that verifies the user's account
3. Users can request a new verification email if needed



4. **Password Reset**:

1. Users can request a password reset via the forgot password page
2. A reset link is sent to their email
3. The reset link contains a token
